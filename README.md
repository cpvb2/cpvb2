- 👋 Hi, I’m @cpvb2
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded software development (my vocation). Video games. Good books. Music. Interesting tech stuff. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning godot. I've also had to dabble in SQL (postgres) recently for work. This is far from my comfort zone.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games. I want to do game development on the side.
- 📫 How to reach me: cpvb2.theblaze@gmail.com
